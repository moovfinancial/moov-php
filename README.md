## Summary

Moov API: Moov is a platform that enables developers to integrate all aspects of money movement with ease and speed.
The Moov API makes it simple for platforms to send, receive, and store money. Our API is based upon REST
principles, returns JSON responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes. To learn more about how Moov
works at a high level, read our [concepts](https://docs.moov.io/guides/get-started/glossary/) guide.

## SDK Installation

The SDK relies on [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to manage its dependencies.

To install the SDK and add it as a dependency to an existing `composer.json` file:
```bash
composer require "moov/moov-php"
```
<!-- End SDK Installation [installation] -->

## SDK Example Usage

### Example

```php
declare(strict_types=1);

require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Moov\MoovPhp;
use Moov\MoovPhp\Models\Components;

$sdk = MoovPhp\Moov::builder()
    ->setSecurity(
        new Components\Security(
            username: '',
            password: '',
        )
    )
    ->build();

$createAccount = new Components\CreateAccount(
    accountType: Components\AccountType::Business,
    profile: new Components\CreateProfile(
        business: new Components\CreateBusinessProfile(
            legalBusinessName: 'Whole Body Fitness LLC',
        ),
    ),
);

$response = $sdk->accounts->create(
    createAccount: $createAccount,
    xMoovVersion: 'v2024.01.00'

);

if ($response->account !== null) {
    // handle response
}
```

## Authentication

### Per-Client Security Schemes

This SDK supports the following security scheme globally:

| Name                      | Type | Scheme     |
| ------------------------- | ---- | ---------- |
| `username`<br/>`password` | http | HTTP Basic |

You can set the security parameters through the `setSecurity` function on the `SDKBuilder` when initializing the SDK. For example:
```php
declare(strict_types=1);

require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Moov\MoovPhp;
use Moov\MoovPhp\Models\Components;

$sdk = MoovPhp\Moov::builder()
    ->setSecurity(
        new Components\Security(
            username: '',
            password: '',
        )
    )
    ->build();

$createAccount = new Components\CreateAccount(
    accountType: Components\AccountType::Business,
    profile: new Components\CreateProfile(
        business: new Components\CreateBusinessProfile(
            legalBusinessName: 'Whole Body Fitness LLC',
        ),
    ),
);

$response = $sdk->accounts->create(
    createAccount: $createAccount,
    xMoovVersion: 'v2024.01.00'

);

if ($response->account !== null) {
    // handle response
}

### [accounts](docs/sdks/accounts/README.md)

* [create](docs/sdks/accounts/README.md#create) - You can create **business** or **individual** accounts for your users (i.e., customers, merchants) by passing the required
information to Moov. Requirements differ per account type and requested [capabilities](https://docs.moov.io/guides/accounts/capabilities/requirements/).

If you're requesting the `wallet`, `send-funds`, `collect-funds`, or `card-issuing` capabilities, you'll need to:
  + Send Moov the user [platform terms of service agreement](https://docs.moov.io/guides/accounts/requirements/platform-agreement/) acceptance.
    This can be done upon account creation, or by [patching](https://docs.moov.io/api/moov-accounts/accounts/patch/) the account using the `termsOfService` field.
If you're creating a business account with the business type `llc`, `partnership`, or `privateCorporation`, you'll need to:
  + Provide [business representatives](https://docs.moov.io/api/moov-accounts/representatives/) after creating the account.
  + [Patch](https://docs.moov.io/api/moov-accounts/accounts/patch/) the account to indicate that business representative ownership information is complete.

Visit our documentation to read more about [creating accounts](https://docs.moov.io/guides/accounts/create-accounts/) and [verification requirements](https://docs.moov.io/guides/accounts/requirements/identity-verification/).
Note that the `mode` field (for production or sandbox) is only required when creating a _facilitator_ account. All non-facilitator account requests will ignore the mode field and be set to the calling facilitator's mode.

* [initiateMicroDeposits](docs/sdks/bankaccounts/README.md#initiatemicrodeposits) - Micro-deposits help confirm bank account ownership, helping reduce fraud and the risk of unauthorized activity. 
Use this method to initiate the micro-deposit verification, sending two small credit transfers to the bank account 
you want to confirm.

If you request micro-deposits before 4:15PM ET, they will appear that same day. If you request micro-deposits any 
time after 4:15PM ET, they will appear the next banking day. When the two credits are initiated, Moov simultaneously
initiates a debit to recoup the micro-deposits. 

Micro-deposits initiated for a `sandbox` bank account will always be `$0.00` / `$0.00` and instantly verifiable once initiated.

You can simulate micro-deposit verification in test mode. See our [test mode](https://docs.moov.io/guides/get-started/test-mode/#micro-deposits)

* [getVerification](docs/sdks/bankaccounts/README.md#getverification) - Retrieve the current status and details of an instant verification, including whether the verification method was instant or same-day 
ACH. This helps track the verification process in real-time and provides details in case of exceptions.

The status will indicate the following:

- `new`: Verification initiated, credit pending to the payment network
- `sent-credit`: Credit sent, available for verification
- `failed`: Verification failed, description provided, user needs to add a new bank account
- `expired`: Verification expired after 14 days, initiate another verification
- `max-attempts-exceeded`: Five incorrect code attempts exhausted, initiate another verification

To access this endpoint using an [access token](https://docs.moov.io/api/authentication/access-tokens/) 
you'll need to specify the `/accounts/{accountID}/bank-accounts.read` scope.
* [initiateVerification](docs/sdks/bankaccounts/README.md#initiateverification) - Instant micro-deposit verification offers a quick and efficient way to verify bank account ownership. 

Send a $0.01 credit with a unique verification code via RTP or same-day ACH, depending on the receiving bank's capabilities. This
feature provides a faster alternative to traditional methods, allowing verification in a single session.

It is recommended to use the `X-Wait-For: rail-response` header to synchronously receive the outcome of the instant credit in the
  response payload.

Possible verification methods:
  - `instant`: Real-time verification credit sent via RTP
  - `ach`: Verification credit sent via same-day ACH

Possible statuses:
  - `new`: Verification initiated, credit pending
  - `sent-credit`: Credit sent, available for verification in the external bank account
  - `failed`: Verification failed due to credit rejection/return, details in `exceptionDetails`

The following formats are accepted:
- `MV0000`
- `mv0000`
- `0000`

<!-- Start Error Handling [errors] -->
## Error Handling

Handling errors in this SDK should largely match your expectations. All operations return a response object or throw an exception.

By default an API error will raise a `Errors\APIException` exception, which has the following properties:

| Property       | Type                                    | Description           |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| `$message`     | *string*                                | The error message     |
| `$statusCode`  | *int*                                   | The HTTP status code  |
| `$rawResponse` | *?\Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface*  | The raw HTTP response |
| `$body`        | *string*                                | The response content  |

When custom error responses are specified for an operation, the SDK may also throw their associated exception. You can refer to respective *Errors* tables in SDK docs for more details on possible exception types for each operation. For example, the `create` method throws the following exceptions:

| Error Type                       | Status Code | Content Type     |
| -------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| Errors\GenericError              | 400, 409    | application/json |
| Errors\CreateAccountResponseBody | 422         | application/json |
| Errors\APIException              | 4XX, 5XX    | \*/\*            |

### Example

```php
declare(strict_types=1);

require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Moov\MoovPhp;
use Moov\MoovPhp\Models\Components;
use Moov\MoovPhp\Models\Errors;

$sdk = MoovPhp\Moov::builder()
    ->setSecurity(
        new Components\Security(
            username: '',
            password: '',
        )
    )
    ->build();

try {
    $createAccount = new Components\CreateAccount(
        accountType: Components\AccountType::Business,
        profile: new Components\CreateProfile(
            business: new Components\CreateBusinessProfile(
                legalBusinessName: 'Whole Body Fitness LLC',
            ),
        ),
    );

    $response = $sdk->accounts->create(
        createAccount: $createAccount,
        xMoovVersion: 'v2024.01.00'

    );

    if ($response->account !== null) {
        // handle response
    }
} catch (Errors\GenericErrorThrowable $e) {
    // handle $e->$container data
    throw $e;
} catch (Errors\CreateAccountResponseBodyThrowable $e) {
    // handle $e->$container data
    throw $e;
} catch (Errors\APIException $e) {
    // handle default exception
    throw $e;
}
```

## Server Selection

### Override Server URL Per-Client

The default server can be overridden globally using the `setServerUrl(string $serverUrl)` builder method when initializing the SDK client instance. For example:
```php
declare(strict_types=1);

require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Moov\MoovPhp;
use Moov\MoovPhp\Models\Components;

$sdk = MoovPhp\Moov::builder()
    ->setServerURL('https://api.moov.io')
    ->setSecurity(
        new Components\Security(
            username: '',
            password: '',
        )
    )
    ->build();

$createAccount = new Components\CreateAccount(
    accountType: Components\AccountType::Business,
    profile: new Components\CreateProfile(
        business: new Components\CreateBusinessProfile(
            legalBusinessName: 'Whole Body Fitness LLC',
        ),
    ),
);

$response = $sdk->accounts->create(
    createAccount: $createAccount,
    xMoovVersion: 'v2024.01.00'

);

if ($response->account !== null) {
    // handle response
}
```

# Development

## Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

## Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically. Any manual changes added to internal files will be overwritten on the next generation. 
We look forward to hearing your feedback. Feel free to open a PR or an issue with a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release.
