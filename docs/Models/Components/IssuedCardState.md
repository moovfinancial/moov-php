# IssuedCardState

The `state` represents the operational status of an issued card.

Authorizations can only be approved while the card is `active`:

- `active`: The card is operational and authorizations can be approved.
- `frozen`: The card is temporarily suspended and authorizations cannot be approved. Set the state back to `active` to reactivate it. A card can move between `frozen` and `active` as often as needed.
- `closed`: The card is permanently deactivated. A card is closed by request or when it expires, and cannot be reopened.
